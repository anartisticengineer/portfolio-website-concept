<h1>Portfolio Concept (Work In Progress)</h1>
<p>A conceptual design for a potential portfolio website using React, along SCSS and BEM methodologies. Includes a responsive design for mobile devices.</p>
<strong>This was a project I originally started in June 2020 while learning React on my own. Ever since the start of my software developer apprenticeship, I am in the process of refactoring the source code in tandem with the topics covered.</strong>
<p>This may eventually be pushed to become an actual website depending on the amount of progress made!</p>
