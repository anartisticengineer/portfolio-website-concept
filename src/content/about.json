    "body": "I am a digital artist/creative coder currently based in Denver, Colorado. I've been doing digital art since about 2017 and creative coding since 2016. As I've grown as an artist over the years, I've been discovering more ways to combine art and technology.\nSpecializing primarily in glitch art, much of my best works come from destroying my photos on purpose. Datamoshing, breaking pixels, pixel sorting, all of that good stuff. I've used my creative coding skills to create my own tool for glitching artworks; a tool whose influence can be seen in much of my latest artworks."
