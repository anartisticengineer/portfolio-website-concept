  "description": "## Find me on Redbubble!\n\nMuch of my work can be purchased as prints over on Redbubble! To hopefully avoid too much convolution as to **where** to find stuff to buy, I included shortcut links to some of the more popular products.\n\n* [](https://bit.ly/cyberArtShop)[](https://www.redbubble.com/people/justin-cyberart/shop?artistUserName=justin-cyberart&asc=u&iaCode=u-clothing)[Art Prints](http://bit.ly/cyberArtShop)\n* [Clothing (mostly shirts)](https://www.redbubble.com/people/justin-cyberart/shop?artistUserName=justin-cyberart&asc=u&iaCode=u-clothing)\n* [Phone Cases](https://bit.ly/cyberCaseShop)\n* [Masks cause of the 'rona](https://www.redbubble.com/people/justin-cyberart/shop?artistUserName=justin-cyberart&asc=u&iaCode=all-masks)\n\nBut dont limit yourself to just this: look around and buy whatever interests you ~ Any purchases are always greatly appreciated! :)\n\n## About NFTs (cause I'm sure people will ask)\n\n**NOTE:** I'm not sure if I will do NFTs, but I will likely do some kind of digital licensing to purchase my art more directly (If enough people are interested!)"
